bookmarks.py is a command line bookmarking thing.

bookmarks.py will be put in the python site packages folder so that you can run python -m bookmarks

this is not finished completely. I have to fix the downloading of the module

to install it, just download <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-CreepArghhh/Python-Bookmarks-Module/master/Bookmarks%20Installer.py" download>the bookmark installer</a> then run the file (recomended).

or you could just <a href="https://github.com/cd-CreepArghhh/Python-Bookmarks-Module/archive/master.zip" download>download the entire project as a zip</a> and run python bookmarks.py (portable).

Note: this module is only compatible for windows. Mac OS and Linux support comming soon.
