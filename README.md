bookmarks.py is a command line bookmarking thing.

bookmarks.py will be put in the python site packages folder so that you can run python -m bookmarks

this is not finished completely. I have to fix the downloading of the module

to install it, just download [the bookmark installer](https://github.com/cd-CreepArghhh/Python-Bookmarks-Module/blob/master/Bookmarks%20Installer.py) then run the file (recomended).

or you could just [download the entire project as a zip](https://github.com/cd-CreepArghhh/Python-Bookmarks-Module/archive/master.zip) and run python bookmarks.py (portable).
